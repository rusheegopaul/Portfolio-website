    <section id ="About">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As mentioned on the home page, I am a BCom student studying business information and technology. During high school itself I had 
            start loving IT since I have decided to persuade my career in IT. It was a quite challenging journey specially dealing with programming, 
            during high school certificate I have worked on visual basic, at that time it was a bit hard to learn but I was able to overcome any 
            difficulties I had.</p>
            <p>In my first year and second semester at Curtin Mauritius I have done the unit of introduction to business programming where I have
                developed some knowledge of python. According to me, python is one among the easiest programming language I have learnt till now. 
                During my second year and first semester I did the unit named database when I have learnt about SQL which is also easy. 
                And, I have done a unit named business analytics technique where I have developed a knowledge of Microsoft power BI. </p>
                <p>And currently I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Basically, this is my first time developing a portfolio website and working 
                    with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In the start it was a bit difficult by as week moved on it went easier. Till now I have no
                    working experience but at the end of this semester I am planning to apply for an internship to gain working experience in IT 
                    field and to develop knowledge about the working life. </p>

        <!--Use w3school- how to-read more read less button--> 
        <p>The development of the portfolio website has been a bit challenging for me, but it was a good experience as <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">   it is my first time working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                During high school certificate I have learnt only some very basic things on HTML. Before developing the website portfolio, 
                I had to work and make modifications on the six websites that are required to be attached together with the website portfolio.
                While developing this portfolio website I have been able to develop some HTML knowledge by myself but mostly with the help of ilecture and w3school.
                Concerning the six websites that must be attached, only some changes in CSS style have been made such as changing the style color and background color and very few changes in the HTML code. 
                For week 2 website I have downloaded another logo from another source for both HTML and CSS logo. The main challenge 
                that I have face is with the ToDoList as during the class itself it was not working.
                So to overcome this challenge, I watched the ilecture and read the code from the UC`s GitHub repository and 
                then I was able to make modifications and correct my code.
                However, reaching the end of the website portfolio I am somehow satisfied with my work and but I
                would hope that I could have get more time to work on it to make it perfect.However, I had difficulty managing
                my time as I have taken too much time to understand the assignment.</span></p>
